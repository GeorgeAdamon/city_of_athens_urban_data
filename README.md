Author : Georgios Adamopoulos
Original Raw Data:  NTUA School of Architecture, Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems in Urban and Regional Planning

This dataset was originally produced as part of the NTUA School of Architecture Thesis Project **"KEMP: A Digital Platform for Participatory Design"** *(Adamopoulos, G., Pappas, P. and Aronidis, E. (2016). KEMP: A Digital Platform for Participatory Design. Master Thesis. National Technical University of Athens, School of Architecture.)* and proved to be a valuable tool for the analysis, filtering and classification of Athens' city blocks.

We open this dataset to any researcher interested in analysing the city of Athens, welcoming additions, corrections and forks.

The numerical data contained in this dataset are original and were computed by the author within the Grasshopper3D plug-in of the Rhinoceros package. They were exported in .shp format via a custom python script, utilizing the pyshp library.

Part of the geometric data ("shapes" or "polygons") contained in this dataset are a derivative of the original data obtained thrpugh the standard procedure from  the Laboratory of Geographical Information Systems in Urban and Regional Planning, in the NTUA School of Architecture. A significant amount of geometric computation and clean-up has been performed on the raw data in order to extract the shapes of the CityBlock Backyards, which were originally produced by the author.
